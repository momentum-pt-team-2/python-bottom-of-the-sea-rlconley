## Your assignment is to generate the lyrics of the song 'There's a Hole in the Bottom of the Sea'.

While you could copy/paste the lyrics, or read them from a file, this problem is much more interesting if you approach it algorithmically, by writing functions.
You'll want to look at what repeats in the text and what doesn't. Think about which parts repeat and which parts do not.
Can you assign values to variables and loop through lists of values to generate these lyrics?


This is a cumulative song of unknown origin.

This is one of many common variants.

```
There's a hole in the bottom of the sea,
There's a hole in the bottom of the sea,
There's a hole, there's a hole,
There's a hole in the bottom of the sea.
There's a log in the hole
In the bottom of the sea,
There's a log in the hole
In the bottom of the sea,
There's a log, there's a log,
There's a log in the hole
In the bottom of the sea.
There's a branch on the log in the hole
In the bottom of the sea,
There's a branch on the log in the hole
In the bottom of the sea,
There's a branch, there's a branch,
There's a branch on the log in the hole
In the bottom of the sea.
There's a bump on the branch on the log
In the hole in the bottom of the sea,
There's a bump on the branch on the log
In the hole in the bottom of the sea,
There's a bump, there's a bump,
There's a bump on the branch on the log
In the hole in the bottom of the sea.
There's a frog on the bump on the branch
On the log in the hole in the bottom of the sea,
There's a frog on the bump on the branch
On the log in the hole in the bottom of the sea,
There's a frog, there's a frog,
There's a frog on the bump on the branch
On the log in the hole in the bottom of the sea.
There's a tail on the frog on the bump on the branch
On the log in the hole in the bottom of the sea,
There's a tail on the frog on the bump on the branch
On the log in the hole in the bottom of the sea,
There's a tail, there's a tail,
There's a tail on the frog on the bump on the branch
On the log in the hole in the bottom of the sea.
There's a speck on the tail on the frog
On the bump on the branch
On the log in the hole in the bottom of the sea,
There's a speck on the tail on the frog
On the bump on the branch
On the log in the hole in the bottom of the sea,
There's a speck, there's a speck,
There's a speck on the tail on the frog
On the bump on the branch on the log
In the hole in the bottom of the sea.
There's a fleck on the speck on the tail
On the frog on the bump on the branch
On the log in the hole in the bottom of the sea,
There's a fleck on the speck on the tail
On the frog on the bump On the branch
On the log in the hole in the bottom of the sea,
There's a fleck, there's a fleck,
There's a fleck on the speck on the tail
On the frog on the bump on the branch
On the log in the hole in the bottom of the sea.
